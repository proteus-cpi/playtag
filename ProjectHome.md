The first goal of Playtag is to support debugging of Gaisler Research LEON3 CPUs over JTAG, using GDB.

It has additional goals of developing reusable Python pieces for communicating over JTAG and for communicating with GDB.

The initial version has some limitations, but is basically up and running with both a digilent USB JTAG cable and an FTDI-based USB cable.  See the manual (PDF or Wiki) for installation instructions.
